Project Name: Roam Insider



Task:

Fix city pages so they are fully populated with extensive content in every section, not just empty headings. All city guide sections should be implemented as scrolling tabs (tabbed navigation at the top, content loads on click).

🔹 Instructions for City Pages
Layout

At the top of each city page, add a scrollable horizontal tab navigation bar.

Each tab corresponds to a section (Overview, Cost of Living, Internet, Transport, Climate, Safety, etc.).

Clicking a tab shows its full content below (smooth scroll or dynamic load).

Sections (ALL must be filled with real content, no placeholders)

Overview & Insider Tips

Short, engaging intro, city vibe, what makes it unique.

Coffee, coworking, gyms, SIM/data packs

🔹 Design & UX
Tabs should be scrollable, with icons (e.g. 💰 for cost, 🌐 for internet, 🚌 for transport).

Each section should look like a mini guidebook:

Tables (for costs INR + USD)

Charts (for climate/weather)

Maps (for transport & attractions)

Lists (for things to do, hacks, festivals)

Keep it classy, elegant, and traveler-themed (unique, not generic).

🔹 Technical
Use Next.js/React components.

All sections must auto-populate with content using:

APIs (weather, internet, events, cost-of-living) → update 2x daily

Internal knowledge for fixed content

If API data is missing, auto-fill with best knowledge available.

No empty placeholders allowed — every section must have content.

🎯 Goal
City pages should feel like a one-stop digital nomad/travel guide.

All sections filled → no “Coming soon”.

Data always in INR + USD.

Smooth, scrollable tab navigation → fun & engaging UX.
